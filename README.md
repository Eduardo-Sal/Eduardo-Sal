## Hey! I'm Eduardo Salinas

Currently pursuing my degree in Computer Engineering at UT Rio Grande Valley. I'm passionate about Embedded Systems and Machine Learning, with a particular interest in combining both fields for Computer Vision applications, such as Medical Imaging, Object Detection, Robotics, and Image Processing. In the realm of Embedded Systems, I have explored subfields like real-time systems, low-power design, and sensor integration. Within Machine Learning, I am particularly interested in deep learning, neural networks, and reinforcement learning. Additionally, I am keen on leveraging Computer Vision with CUDA for efficient parallel processing, enabling high-performance image and video processing tasks.
